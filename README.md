# shellfirebox-files
Files to be included on the rom to make this a shellfirebox, not just an openwrt router with luci-app-shellfirebox

warning: patching these might harm your existing openwrt installation. use with care!

in the build-scripts folder you can also see that all boxes get their own uid, ssid and wpa key randomly assigned.
